To do list and questions:
-----------------------
Layout: 28/06/2020 

1. will use grid for laying out whole website then flex for smaller spacing and centring elements. 
2. make sure I identified the parents aka containers and its childreen so check all the classes of the containers. 
3. reapeting classes like center helps to not repeat your codes over and over again.
